# Introductions/Concepts/Projects
During our first week we have two general goals. 
1. Explore the spatial humanities through some concrete projects and examples. With an emphasis on ethical approaches to working with data and communities.
2. Look at and discuss Github and OSF as potential spaces for documenting and sharing projects.

Readings:
[Jen Jack Gieseking, Where are We? The Method of Mapping with GIS in Digital Humanities.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CvCYGT2Aa5QrVfEC0HtZ-q5hkQZYr1aR/view?usp=sharing)
- Short and accessible overview to GIS and DH.

Additional Readings:
HyperCities: Thick Mapping in the Digital Humanties
The Spatial Humanities GIS and the Future of Humanities Scholarship 

Tuesday September 29th: 
In this first session we will look at some digital projects and start thinking about the methods, tools, and techniques that were used in creating them.
What’s the Point?: 

Point maps are one of the easiest and most useful types of maps to use for spatial thinking. They quickly provide insight and the opportunity to ask research questions about people, place, relationships, historical context, and so on. It is also one of the easiest first steps in terms of getting started with doing GIS.


What do you need to create a point map?
A CSV file with latitude and longitude data.
Metadata to help describe each location
Date (YEAR/MONTH/DAY format is best practice)
Name
Description
Anything else that you will find helpful
Have a “working” file and an “original” file


Learning Outcomes:
Develop a shared language around core spatial/GIS concepts, methods, and approaches
Identify potential tools and methods that can be used in your research
Gain understanding of time commitments necessary for incorporating spatial methods and tools

Thursday, October 1st:
Guided discussion on projects that have inspired/impacted your work. In particular we will identify GIS methods that you will want to explore of the next few weeks. It may be georeferencing historical maps, creating a dataset of points, 

Identify and think about methods that you might want to apply to your own work.
